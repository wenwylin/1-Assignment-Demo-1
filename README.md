### Instruction to students:
1. Your codes/program should be able to accept **1 word of user's name** (e.g. John) and display "Hello, John!!" (without quotes) on the terminal.
2. Input from user (through std::cin):  
    - char name[20];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(use **any name** suitable, and use **any size** suitable for the char).
3. Function(s) that is/are required (feel free to add more functions if necessary): **NONE**  
4. Example output on the terminal (through std::cout):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter your name > John\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, John!!
5. Marks:
    - You will get **0** mark if your output does not match ALL the conditions shown in 4. (space, capital block, comma, etc.).
    - You will get **3** (full marks) if your output does match ALL the conditions.
    - Your codes/program must be **free from any warning** - your final mark later will be deducted for the warnings.
6. Take note:
    - The repository by default, after you clone it, is not compilable due to a lot of missing things.
    - Use any required header file(s), e.g. &lt;iostream&gt;, &lt;math&gt;, etc.
    - Use the main.hpp file for your function(s) declaration stated in 3. above.
    - The user type their name on the same line as the "Enter your name >" prompt.
    - There is "Hello, " before the user's name.
    - There is "!!" after the user's name.
    - Any variable (including variable(s) described in 2.) needs to be declared inside the main(), or inside the function(s) that you created - **do not use global variables**.
    - You need to make sure that your codes/program **can be executed** by the GitHub Classroom Workflow, so that the auto-grading can be performed (observe for the **green tick** on the repository page).
    - **DO NOT DELETE OR EDIT** the other files/folder (i.e. LICENSE, Makefile).
    - You MAY DELETE the .vscode folder and its content but you need to add the "-Wall" and "Wconversion" inside the tasks.json for debugging while you are on Visual Studio Code.
7. Before you commit for grading, make sure you have **editted/filled your details below and inside the main.cpp file**.
